# LiveView

Liteskill's UI is built entirely with Phoenix LiveView. The interface is composed of several LiveView modules, each handling a different feature area.

## Live Sessions

The router defines several live sessions with different auth requirements:

| Session | Mount Hook | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `:auth` | `redirect_if_authenticated` | Login/register (redirects away if already logged in) |
| `:setup` | `require_setup_needed` | First-time admin setup |
| `:admin` | `require_admin` | Admin-only routes |
| `:chat` | `require_authenticated` | All authenticated user routes |

## LiveView Modules

## Auth Hooks

`LiteskillWeb.Plugs.LiveAuth` provides `on_mount` callbacks:

- `:redirect_if_authenticated` — Redirects to `/` if already logged in
- `:require_admin` — Requires admin role
- `:require_setup_needed` — Only allows access during initial setup

## Real-Time Updates

LiveView receives real-time updates via PubSub:

- **Streaming chunks** — LLM response chunks update the UI in real-time
- **Tool call status** — Tool call progress and results
- **Run updates** — Agent run status and log entries
- **Conversation list** — New messages update conversation metadata
